# Precision Medicine - Past, Present, & Future

## Table of Contents:
### 1. Introduction

  If every individual on the planet has their own unique genetic makeup, one that distinguishes them from every other person, why are they seen as the same when treating diseases? Each treatment applies differently for each individual, it may or may not be effective, or might not have the same effects on every patient. So how is this problem approached? With Precision Medicine!  
  According to the National Research Council’s Toward Precision Medicine, precision medicine is defined as, “the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient”.$$.^1$$ Precision Medicine (PM), is being able to improve the treatment for patients, while reducing the need for unnecessary diagnostic testing, therapies, and misdiagnoses. It is a philosophy of medicine that treats patients based on an understanding of their genetics, instead of “assigning” patients to a treatment, a treatment is made catering to the patient.  
  The goal of PM is not only to develop a health care system in which research is carried out in the context of clinical care, but also it is optimizing the treatment and knowledge used to deliver improved patient outcomes.$^1$ By incorporating patient data, i.g. DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolism, epigenome, and environmental aspects, Precision Medicine can utilize these essential factors into techniques such as, patient subtyping, biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and personalized treatment.  
  Today, a large number of precision medicine techniques are implemented to healthcare to help individuals before birth, at birth, and throughout their lifetime. For example, when an expecting mother is about 8 – 12 weeks pregnant, she may have genetic testing to assess any chromosomal abnormalities of the fetus, and the fetus’ entire genome may even be sequenced. At birth, sequencing can be utilized in rapidly diagnosing any factor that may lead to reduced mortality. Throughout an individual’s life, these precision medicine techniques can be used in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases, especially in accurately diagnosing cancer and applying the correct therapy for chronic diseases.$^1$
